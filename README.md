# Information Extraction - Assignment 2

<b>Student Id: 17230755</b>


### Overview:
This assignment is regarding Information extraction in a football player data set. I have used a standford tagger for Named Entity extraction. 

Please Note:

    - Need to set environment to os.environ['JAVAHOME'] = "C:/Program Files/Java/jre1.8.0_144/bin/" (corresponding relative path should be given according to the system)
    - Need to downlaod the standfor NER tagger from the site here - http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-postagger-full-2015-04-20.zip
    - If this dosent work - please uncomment the code in name_0f_the_player function. Instruction is given in comments.

Please make sure txt file is in working directory.


```python
# Please make sure the txt file is in home directory
inputfile='football_players.txt'
buf=open(inputfile, encoding="UTF-8")
list_of_doc=buf.read().split('\n')


# Removing all empty lines i.e empty lines between paragraph
l = []
for i in list_of_doc:
    if len(i) != 0:
        l.append(i)
list_of_doc = l
```

# Task 1 (10 Marks)
Write a function that takes each document and performs:
1) sentence segmentation 2) tokenization 3) part-of-speech tagging

Please keep in mind that the expected output is a list within a list as shown below.

All abobve mentioned process is done.


```python
def ie_preprocess(document):
    
    '''This function pos tag the sentences and stores in the list'''
    
    # Convert string into list of sentences
    sentence = sent_tokenize(document)
    pos_sentences = []
    try:
        for i in sentence:
            # Tokenize each sentence
            text = word_tokenize(i)
            # Tag the tokenizeed sentence
            pos_sentences.append(nltk.pos_tag(text))
        return pos_sentences
    except:
        print("Please make sure that input to the function is of type string")
```


```python
first_doc=list_of_doc[0]
# Calling the ie_preprocess function
pos_sent = ie_preprocess(first_doc)

# Display all tagged sentences as given in the assignment sheet. However, to dissplay all tagged sentence, please remove the 
# list index
pos_sent[1]
```




    [('He', 'PRP'),
     ('is', 'VBZ'),

     ('as', 'IN'),
     ('captain', 'NN'),
     ('for', 'IN'),
     ('Portugal', 'NNP'),
     ('.', '.')]



# Task 2 (20 Marks)
Write a function that will take the list of tokens with POS tags for each sentence and returns the named entities (NE). 

Hint: Use binary=True while calling NE chunk function.


```python
def named_entity_finding(pos_sent, x=True, y="NE"):
    
    """This functions identifies the named entities in a given pos tagged sentence. This logic is used in another 
    function to change binary=True in ne_chunk. Hence given the default parameters in the function. 
    Also using this we can find the NE labeled - person or location... etc default is person.""" 
    
    # This is check if the return needs all NE or specific NE - default type is PERSON.
    if y != "NE":
        x=False
        if y=="NE":
            y = "PERSON"
    myNE = []
    
    
    # The below logic finds all named entities like, PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION etc
    try:
        tree = nltk.ne_chunk(pos_sent, binary=x)

        for subtree in tree.subtrees():
            if subtree.label() == y:
                entity = ""
                for leaf in subtree.leaves():
                    entity = entity + leaf[0] + " "
                myNE.append(entity.strip())

        return myNE
    except:
        print("Please make sure to give parsed tree as input to the function.")

        
# Calling the above function - specific document need to be passed.
pos_sents=ie_preprocess(list_of_doc[0])
# passing the first sentence of document 4 to findd nam
named_entity_finding(pos_sents[0])

# Task 3 (10 Marks)

Now use the named_entity_finding() function to extract all NEs for each document.

Hint: pos_sents holds the list of lists of tokens with POS tags.

Note: Only few list of NE is displayed.


```python
def NE_flat_list_fn(document):
    """This function is extracts named entities in entire document and returns all unique NE as flattened list"""
    NE=[]
    try:
        # Loop through each docudment 1-10
        for i in document:
            # POS tag the document
            pos_sents = ie_preprocess(i)
            for pos_sent in pos_sents:
                # For each tagged sentence in document find named entity
                entity = named_entity_finding(pos_sent)
                if len(entity) != 0:
                    NE.append(entity)

        
        # This function flattens the list
        NE_flat_list = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(NE))
        return NE_flat_list
    except:     
        print("Please make sure that input to the function is off type string")

        
ne_flat = NE_flat_list_fn(list_of_doc)

# Note set is used to return the unique named entities - only 10 named entites are displayed here. 
# There are multiple same named entities - However, for any process - if we take the unique NE it is better in tems of memory. 
# This set can also be declared instind the NE_flat_list_n.

# Task 4 (40 Marks)

Write functions to extract the name of the player, country of origin and date of birth as well as the following relations: team(s) of the player and position(s) of the player.

Hint: Use the re.compile() function to create the extraction patterns

# Task 5 - Json-ld

Here, first we need to generate the data, because arguments is given as list to generate_jsonld function. I have provided with two solution.
    
<b>Solution 1:</b> Simple store the required format in a variable as give the arguments where required. However, not sure wheteher the return type needed is linked data format. Hence given another solution using pyld to get Json ld.
    
<b>Solution 2:</b> Used Pyld to generated Json ld. It contains context and doc - to use this data as linked data then contex and doc is necessay. However, in given format in assignment dosent contain context section. Hence poping context from json ld (not sure if this is allowed - linked data needs context).



Below is the data generaton function to convert all arguments to list.


```python
def data_generator(doc):
    
    data = [name_of_the_player(doc), date_of_birth(doc), country_of_origin(doc), position_of_the_player(doc), team_of_the_player(doc)]
    
    return data


data = data_generator(list_of_doc[0])
print(data)

# Task 6 - Debut Year and Debut Age

I have take debut year and debut age of the player. However, it is important to note that, these two values are not available for all the players. Hence, if debut year or debut age is not present I have added as "Not Available".


```python
def relation_debutYearAge(doc):

    Note - this information if not available for all the players"""
    
    sent = sent_tokenize(doc)
    deb = []
    ag = []
    # For each sentence check if the debut key is present or not
    for se in sent:
        sp_sent = se.split()
        
        if "debut" in sp_sent:
            # If debut year is present jecy for 4 digit number.
            date = re.findall('\d{4}', " ".join(sp_sent))
            if len(date) !=0:
                deb.append(date[0])
        
        # Check for debut and age key in a sentence - 
        if "debut" in sp_sent and "aged" in sp_sent:
            # Search for 2 digit number and append to the list.
            age = re.findall('\d{2}', " ".join(sp_sent))
            ag.append(age[0])       
    
    # If the above process dosent return anything, insert year and age is not available.
    if len(deb) == 0:
        deb.append("Not Available")
    if len(ag) == 0:
        ag.append("Not Available")

    return [deb[0], ag[0]]

relation_debutYearAge(list_of_doc[1])


# Note: Debut year or debut age is not available for all the sntences (3,7). Moreover, some of the sentence has only
# debut age, while the others has only debut year.
